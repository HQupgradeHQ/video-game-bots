# OS Level Interception Data

## Tools

We will work with Windows API frunctions in this chapter. C++ language is the best choice for this task. We will use the [Visual Studio 2015 Community IDE](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx#) to compile our examples. More details about this IDE is available in the [In-game Bots](../InGameBots/tools.md) section.

There are several open source solutions to simplify process of hook WinAPI calls. We will use the [Deviare](http://www.nektra.com/products/deviare-api-hook-windows/) open source hooking engine.

There are steps to install Deviare software:

1. Download the last version of the [release binaries](https://github.com/nektra/Deviare2/releases/download/v2.8.0/Deviare.2.8.0.zip).

2. Download the latest version of the [source code](https://github.com/nektra/Deviare2/archive/v2.8.0.zip).

3. Unpack both archives in two different directories.

You can find a list of all available releases in the [github project](https://github.com/nektra/Deviare2/releases). Please make sure that the version of binaries matches to the version of sources.
