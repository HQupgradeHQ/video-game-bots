# Purpose of Bots

What are video game bots needed for? This is the first question popping into your mind when you hear about video game bots. We can make a step backward and think about history and reasons for inventing bots. 

First mention of bots appears in the first-person shooter (FPS) games. The problem arises when people start to compete in a "player vs player" mode also known as deathmatch. Sometimes players wanted to practice without human opponents or they just did not have any possibility to connect with other players. Deathmatch game mode differs great from the single player one, where primitive AI is enough. The AI in deathmatch should be more complicated and imitate human behavior better. It is not only responsible for finding and attacking real player (like single player mode AI does), but for more. Now AI should select the route on the map, decide when it will be favorable to attack player or retreat for recovery and many other things. This kind of AI has been named bot.

Video game evolution brings a new kind of problems. Massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) genre has been becoming more and more popular simultaneously with Internet penetration. New genre has a lot in common with the classic role-playing game (RPG) one. But now game process became more stretched for a time because of many players' participation and intention of the game developers to keep players' interest for as long as possible. This leads to increasing time of the player's character improvement. Now you should spend weeks or months on performing quests and resources extraction. All of this work is required for achieving the level of character enough to start competing with other players. The main attraction of MMORPG is this kind of competition with human opponents.

Many players might describe the process of character improvement as very monotonous, having huge amount of simple repeating actions. They decide to start looking for ways to automate these tedious tasks. Sometimes MMORPG developers provide tools for plugin creation with trivial automation features. But usually there is more to it. New approaches and workarounds should be discovered to really extend MMORPG functionality to suit your particular needs. MMORPG developers do not benefit from this functionality, so they would not usually implement it. These custom applications have been named MMORPG bots. Perhaps, the reason of this name is imitation of the player's behavior that is very similar to the bots for FPS genre.

Automation of the game process is not the only task that has emerged with appearance of new online game genres. Some players compete with others such enthusiastically that they start looking for ways to avoid game limitations (or rules) and thus get an advantage over opponents. These ways include such approaches as showing additional information that unavailable in usual mode, changing characteristics of the player's and opponent's characters, immediately receiving necessary resources and others. Applications for achieving these goals are called cheats or bots sometimes.

You have seen that game bots may be quite necessary in some cases like training player's character in multiplayer online games. Bots are also useful for automating many monotonous game processes so that you can start competing with human opponents faster. The last application domain of bots is cheating and avoiding game limitations to take advantage over opponents.
