# Purpose of Bots

What are video game bots needed for? This is the first question popping into your mind when you hear about video game bots.

Let's make a step backward and think about history and reasons of inventing the bots. First mention of the bots appears in the first-person shooter (FPS) games. The problem appears than people start to compete in player vs player mode also known as deathmatch. Sometimes players wanted to practice without human opponents ors they just didn't have a possibility to connect with other players. Deathmatch game mode differs well from the single player one where primitive AI have been enough. The AI should be more complicated and close to human behaviour. His responsibility don't consist only in three steps to see the player, attack him and die like in single player mode. Now AI should select the route on the map, decide when it will be favorable to attack player or retreat for recovery an many other things. This kind of AI have been named bots.

A video game evolution brings a new kind of problems. Massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) genre became more and more popular simultaneously with Internet penetration. New genre has a lot in common with the classic role-playing game (RPG) genre. But now game process became more stretched for a time because of many players participation and intention of the game developers to keep players' interest as long as possible. This leads to increasing time of the player's character improvement. Now you should spend weeks and mounths for performing quests and resources extraction. All this work is needed to achieve enough level of character for starting compete with another players. The main interest of MMORPG is this kind of competition with human opponents.

Some players detects that process of the character improvement is very monotonous and consist of simple repeated actions. They decide to looking for the ways of automation this kind of work. Sometimes MMORPG developers provide tools to create plugins with simplest automation goal. But the new unintended approaches to extend MMORPG functionality should be discovered in most cases. This kind of applications have been named bots too. Perhaps, the reason of this is imitation of the player behaviour that is very similar to bots for FPS genre.

Automation of the game process isn't the only task that have been appeared by new on-line game genres. Some players competes with others as enthusiastically that they start to looking ways to avoid game limitation and thus get an advantage over the opponents. This ways include such approaches as showing information that unavailable in usual mode, changing characteristics of the player's character, receiving the necessary resources immediately and others. Application for reaching these goals are named cheats or sometimes bots.
