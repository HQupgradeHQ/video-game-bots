# Purpose of Bots

What are video game bots needed for? This is the first question popping into your mind when you hear about video game bots. Really, the video games are developed to make players fun and relax. But this question is not so simple as it seems.

Let's look at the gameplay process of typical role-playing game (RPG).

You start playing by character without any powerful items and capabilities. The long path of killing monsters with primitive behavior and performing boring quests lies in front of you. This is the most obvious way to get game resources, items and improve your character's skills. The most interesting part of the game is fighting and competing with other players. Before that features become available you have to complete the long path of your character improvement.

An alternative way to improve your character is in-game purchases. Modern video games in most cases allow you to buy all necessary equipment to quickly start competing with other players and having fun. Gameplay process started to look like this:

But the question is are you sure that you will find exact what you want after paying a load of money and competing with players give you expected pleasure?

The idea of automation the improvement process of your character visits you here. The monotonous repeated actions of killing obedient monsters or performing the quests are exact things that can be automated well. You can just put boring tasks on the shoulders of the bot application and have fun when it completes the work. This kind of automation is just one example of various purposes bots can serve.

Another case that make you think about changing something is video games with difficult interface of controlling your character. The most known example of this case is Warcraft III Defense of the Ancients (DotA) mod. The gameplay was significant changed in this
mod compared to gameplay of the original game. Developers have not possibility to make suitable user interface because of Warcraft III mod development tools limitations. The player should remember the hotkeys for each of 112 available characters and this is impossible to change ones. The bot application is able to help you here too. The keyboard keys mapping is an elementary task that able to be done with the simple script. Moreover, you can improve interface by some automation of common performed actions like macros that allow you to bind several keystrokes on single keyboard key, automatically target search on the game screen for selected action and etc.

The last case when bots applications can be handy is you really want to cheat and avoid the game limitations. The most common example of this task is showing the invisible things at the game screen like other players, object parameters and etc. The bot application should penetrate inside your game`s algorithms and data after that extract the information that you needed.

As you have seen, bot applications able to make your life easy and get more fun of playing your favorite video game.
