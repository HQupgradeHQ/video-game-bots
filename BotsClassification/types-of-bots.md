# Types of Bots

## Community Classification

You can often hear about **in-game** and **out-game** types of bots when trying to discover the information regarding bots in Internet. These terms are widely used and well known in the gamers community.

In-game bot is a software that is embed inside the game client application's memory. It provides own functionality by extending capabilities of the game client. This is an illustration of the in-game bot interaction with a game application:

Out-game bot is a software that works outside the game client application's memory. First kind of out-game bots doesn't need the game application at all. The bot substitutes the game client. Thus, game server supposes that it communicate with an usual game client application while this is an out-game bot. This is an illustration how this kind of out-game bots work:

Second kind of out-game bots works with a game client application in parallel. The bots able to intercept the state of the game objects and to notify the game application about the simulated player's actions through the OS:

Also you can faced with a mention about **clicker** bots. This is a special case of the out-game bots that works with a game application in parallel. Clicker bot sends the keyboard and mouse events notifications to the game application through the system libraries or drivers.

We will use **community classification** term for naming these three kinds of bots.

## Developers Classification

The **community classification** is quite convenient for users of bot applications. But this is not enough for bot developers. The problem is the classification doesn't reflect how the bot application actually works and what kind of approaches it uses. It will be better to consider the methods that bot application uses for [intercept data about the game objects and embed data about the simulated player's actions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2741040/video-game-bots) as a bots classification basis.

Let's consider points in our scheme of the game application where a bot able to intercept the state of the game objects. The points of data interception is marked by the red crosses:

![Intercepting Data by Bot](input-data-bot.png)

This is a list of the data interception points:

1. **Output devices**. It is possible to capture data from the output devices like monitor or audio card. Game objects have specific colors and game events is accompanied by a specific sounds often. You can compare these colors or sounds with the predefined values. This allows you to make conclusion about the current state of the objects.

2. **Operation system**. You can substitute or modify some libraries or drivers of operation system. This allows you to trace the interaction between game application and OS. Another way is launching game application under an emulator of the operation system like Wine. Emulators have an advanced logging system often. Thus, you will get a detailed information about each step of the game application work.

3. **Game server**. The network packets that are sent to the game application from the game server can be intercepted. The current state of the game objects is transmitted by this way in most cases.

4. **Game client application**. You can get access to the game application memory and gather necessary information from there.

Result of the bot application work is simulated player actions that should be transmitted to the game server. This is a scheme specifies the points marked as green crosses where bot application able to embed its notifications:

This is a list of the data embedding points:

1. **Input device**. Special devices can be used for emulation usual input devices. You can use Arduino board that emulates the keyboard behavior and that is controlled by bot application for example.

2. **Operation system**. Components of the operation system able to be modified for becoming controlled by the bot application. You can modify a keyboard driver and allow a bot to notify the OS about keyboard actions through the driver for example. Thus, OS will not have possibility to distinguish whether the keyboard event really happened or it was embed by the bot. Also you can use a standard OS interface of applications interaction to notify game application about the embedded by bot keyboard events.

3. **Game server**. Bot application able to send network packets with the  simulated actions directly to the game server the same way as it always done by the game client application. Game server have not possibility to distinguish the source of the network packet in some cases.

4. **Game client application**. The bot simulated actions able to be embedded directly to the state of the current game that is held in the game application memory. Thus, game application will consider that a new state have been updated in a legal way and will send notification about it to the game server.

We will use **developer classification** term for naming this division of bots into the types by interception and embedding data approaches.

## Summary

This is a table that summarize the community and developers bots classification:

![Types of Bots](types-of-bots.png)

Each crossing of the row and column defines type of a bot application that uses respective methods of the data interception and data embedding. Community classification defined types of the bots are placed into the corresponding cells. 

You can see plus and minus signs into each cell. This means an approximate evaluation of two parameters combination for each type of bot:

1. How it is difficult to use this approach for bot developer?

2. How is effective and reliable (error-free) the bot that uses this approach?

This is a description of the possible values:

The **â€“** sing means that this combination of data interception and embedding methods requires an unreasonable work effort. Effectiveness and reliability of result able to be achieved with another approaches and less efforts.

The **+** sing means that this combination of methods allows you to achieve accurate and effective solution and requires a reasonable work efforts.

The **++** sign marks the combinations of methods that allow you to achieve the most effective or the simplest for implementation solutions.

Now we can briefly explain the evaluation:

1. **Network** packets analysis is one of the most difficult way to intercept the game data. You should realize a communication protocol between the game client and the game server. Obviously this is not any official documentation regarding the protocol. All that a bot developer have is a game application binary and examples of the already intercepted network packets in most cases. Moreover, network packets are encrypted often and sometimes you have not possibility to decrypt it definitely. On the other hand, this approach provides the most precise and complete data about the state of game objects. Bots that are based on the network packets interception able to be most efficient thanks to this detailed data.

2. **Memory** analysis is a second difficulty approach to intercept the game data. Game developers distribute their applications in binary codes that produced by compiler after processing the source code. You have not chance to get the exact source code of the application to investigate algorithms and data structures. Protection systems able to relocate and to encrypt the information regarding to game objects in the application memory. Patching game application memory is quite dangerous method of embedding data because of possibility to crash the application. But this approach provides almost the same accurate game data as the network packets analyzing one.

3. Capture of the **Output Device** data is one of the simplest approach of the data interception. But the result of this approach is not reliable. The  algorithms of image analysis wrong in some cases for example. The evaluation of this approach effectiveness depends well from the concrete game application.

4. Embedding data with **Input Device** is a good way to avoid some types of the anti-cheat protection systems. But you need to buy a device itself and write an appropriate firmware for it. It is make sense to use this approach only in case of necessary to avoid game application protection. The embedding data on the OS level works quite similar but it is more simple to detect by protection system.

5. Intercept data with **OS** able to be very universal and reliable method. You can find already available Open Source solutions for the [system library substitution](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~mdfisher/D3D9Interceptor.html) that allows you gather information about the game application work.

You can see that the community classification covers most effective and the simplest for implementation combinations of the intercepting and embedding data methods. On the other hand, the rare used and ineffective methods combinations doesn't mentioned by community classification. We will use the community classification in this book primarily. The developers classification will be used in cases when it is important to emphasize the bot's algorithms.
