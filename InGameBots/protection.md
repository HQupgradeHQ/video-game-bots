# Protection Approaches

**This section is still under development.**

We have considered approaches to develop in-game bots. Now we will investigate methods to protect game application against these bots. Let us split protecton methods into two groups:

1. Methods against investiagtion and reverse engineering of the game application.

2. Methods against algorithms of in-game bots.

First group of methods is well known methods that allow you to make it complicate to debug application and explore its memory. Second group of methods allows you to violate a normal work of bot application. Yes, some of methods are able to be refer to both groups. We will emphasize the main goal of each method.

## Test Application

TODO: Describe an algorithm of the test application.

TODO: Describe the simplest bot for test application.

## Approaches Against Investiagtion

TODO: Consider anti-debugging and anti-reversing approaches here.

## Approaches Against Bots

TODO: Consider approaches to protect application memory here.
