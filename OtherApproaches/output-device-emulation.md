# Output Device Emulation

## Tools

First of all we should choose hardware for emulation input devices. This is a list of hardware features, which are important for our goals:

1. Low price of the device.
2. IDE and compiler should be available for free.
3. IDE should have libraries for emulation input devices.
4. Active project community and good documentation.

Arduino board has all of these features. This hardware is a good choice if you do not have experience with embedded development. Next question is which version of Arduino board you should choose. Arduino IDE provides [libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseKeyboard) to emulate keyboard and mouse devices. According to the documentation 
some of boards do not support these libraries. Appropriate versions of boards for you are Leonardo, Micro and Due.

Second topic after gathering the hardware is to choose a software for development. Arduino IDE with compiler and libraries is available on the [official website](http://www.arduino.org/downloads).
