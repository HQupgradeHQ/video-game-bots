## [**Application binary interface ABI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)
ABI is the interface between two program modules, one of which is often a library or operating system, at the level of machine code. An ABI determines such details as how functions are called and in which binary format information should be passed from one program component to the next, or to the operating system in the case of a system call. 

[**Application Programming Interface (API)**](http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/37856/api) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools used by an application program to communicate with the operating system or some other control program such as a database management system (DBMS) or communications protocol.
