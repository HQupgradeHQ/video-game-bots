# Video Game Bots

Sometimes when you play in your favorite video game you can discover yourself by performing some repeated simple actions. Perhaps, this process remind you a work with manual old machine. You should mount a detail, press the button for launch the drill, pull the lever down and etc. But wait a moment. We are life in XXI century and people learned how to automate simple monotonous actions long ago. Approximately this kind of thoughts have visited me when I played my favorite video game.

After that I decide to looking for ways of this kind of automation. Plenty of forums and websites have been visited. Most of the applications for game automations that I have found contained a malicious software. Some of them were clear but doesn't work at all. Sometimes, peoples with strange nicknames suggest me to buy this black magic applications that will solve all my problems. But it seemed strange to buy something without guarantee from anonymous person in Internet at the moment. I have realised why bots developers prefer to hide they names much later. Thus, my search failed.

Next my step was attempt to implement bot by myself. And I faced with a leak of the systematic documentation about the topic. This situation looks very strange despite the fact that bot applications often solves difficult algorithmic tasks and based on several information technology domains. This kind of software able to be very complex. Moreover, there are a lot of solutions and approaches have been discovered and suggested in bot development. Why nobody don't care about sharing this kind of information?

This book is an attempt to overcome this information vacuum around the topic of bot development. You can find one of the possible classification of the bots by types here. Also we will consider work mechanisms of different kind of bots and will try to write simple prototypes. You will known about tools for bot development as well as about the anti-cheating systems for preventing the bot usage.

The book will be interested for all players who want to discover new sense and approach to the game process. It will be useful for players who don't care about a question how bot applications works but who just want to buy one and launch it. You will known what kind of bots available for you and what kind of bots exploiting issues await you.

I hope everybody will find something interesting and new in this book.
